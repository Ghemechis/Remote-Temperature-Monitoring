ABSTRACT
Fever happens when the body's internal "thermostat" raises the body temperature above its normal level. This thermostat is found in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus knows what temperature your body should be (usually around 98.6°F/37°C) and will send messages to your body to keep it that way.
Most people's body temperatures change a little bit during the course of the day: It's usually a little lower in the morning and a little higher in the evening and can vary as kids run around, play, and exercise.
Sometimes, though, the hypothalamus will "reset" the body to a higher temperature in response to an infection, illness, or some other cause. Why? Researchers believe that turning up the heat is a way for the body to fight the germs that cause infections, making it a less comfortable place for them. Raise in body temperature is symptom of infection and it will have adverse effect on children if not monitored well and treated.

PROBLEM
There has been an increased death in a number of infants because of fever in Uganda; 
in healthy kids, not all fevers need to be treated. High fever, though, can make a child uncomfortable and make problems (such as dehydration) worse.

SOLUTION
A temperature monitoring app has been designed to monitor the temperature of infants in case he/she is anticipated of having fever and the doctor can decide on whether to treat a fever by considering both the temperature and a child's overall condition.

PROJECT STRUCTURE
The application has a provision of creating an account by signing up and monitors body temperature by using a temperature sensor through Bluetooth connection.

PLATFORMS UTILIZED
Adrino Uno; this is a micro controller that is used to pick data from the temperature sensor and send through Bluetooth module to the phone.

Firebase real time database; this database is used to store, authenticate, and keep the user details information and also store the temperature that can f accessed by the doctor directly from firebase.

Android studio; this was used to write code and connect the activities to the firebase.

Features of the App.
This app utilizes data persistence by using firebase database, Broadcast receiver, Service (where by it utilizes media player to play a song from the background), utilizes activities like the main activity, login activity, signup activity etc.
